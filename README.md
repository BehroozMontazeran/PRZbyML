This repo is a bachelor thesis about the application of AI in financial markets containing implementation and thesis. For more details read the article "Artificial Intelligence in Technical trading" in the repo.


## Abstract_ 


Imagine a situation in which there is a logical fast senseless system that can observe the whole history of a security and a half-logical, not enough fast in processing the huge amount of data, indecisive person who can decide just only based on a limited period of time and they would like both to take profit from trading of that security, which one can make more profit and loss less money on the trading?!!
When there are plenty of tools with different outputs and a long period of time as a history of the security, humankind cannot decide perfectly which output and how long of history to choose to optimize the one second decision of purchase or sale in an online trading platform.
The main idea of this paper is based on discovering a reliable method to determine the resistance and support levels of a security on a price chart with the help of nearly all the available tools in technical trading or price action methods, confidently. Moreover, I will give the idea of locating some particular technical tools, which are specific to a particular share, cryptocurrency, commodity or currency pairs in Forex that a trader can rely on them more than other tools and so make better decisions when observing the output of them in the PRZs.
All actions above are possible with the help of computers systems, but when they all are done through the capabilities of AI, the result can be variously characteristic and more authentic.
To achieve the ultimate goal, I have used both supervised, unsupervised algorithms and the attributes of preprocessing such as feature selection and standardization.
